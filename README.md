# Distributed-Battery-Management-System-controller-boards

This repository contains the hardware design files of the cell-level controller boards of a distributed Battery Management System.

The boards are designed using Easily Applicable Graphical Layout Editor (EAGLE) 7.1.0 for Windows. However, they can be viewed and edited using other versions also. 

A journal paper explaining the individual modules of the cell-level controller is under review and will be soon updated to this repository.
